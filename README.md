The works in this repo are to demonstrate skill sets in the area of data acquisition (web crawler), cleaning/preprocessing (Python/R), storage/query (SQL), analysis, as well as visualization (JavaScript).<br>
<br>
To showcase the skillsets in each area, I crawled some data sets related to automotive industry and did basic analysis of the datasets.
The statistics cover three aspects of the automotive industry:<br>
I. Car sales data by Brand (2016 May YTD vs 2017 May YTD)<br> 
II. Car sales data by Global Region (2005-2016) <br>
III. Car resale market (car attributes and resale prices)<br> 
<br>
The dashboard on point I & II is available at: <br>

Some basic analysis in R on point II is available at:<br>
